# Filepicker::Rails

Adds form, image_tag, and download/save helpers to help you get up and running with [filepicker.io](http://filepicker.io) in Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'filepicker-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install filepicker-rails

Add the filepicker.io javascript library to your layout:

    <%= filepicker_js_include_tag %>

Set your API Key in config/application.rb:

    config.filepicker_rails.api_key = "Your filepicker.io API Key"

## Usage

### Adding an upload field to your form:

    <%= form_for @user do |f| %>
      <div>
        <%= f.label :avatar_url, "Upload Your Avatar:" %>
        <%= f.filepicker_field :avatar_url %> <!-- User#avatar_url is a regular string column -->
      </div>

      <%= f.submit %>
    <% end %>

Full options list:
* button_text - The text of the upload button.
* button_class - The class of the upload button.
* mimetypes - The file types you want to support for this upload. Ex: "image/png,text/*"
* container - Where to show the file picker dialog can be "modal", "window" or the
of an iframe on the page.
* services - What services your users can upload to. Ex: "BOX, COMPUTER, FACEBOOK".
* multiple - Set to 'true' if you'd like users to be able to upload multiple files.  NOTE that this requires then iterating over each file name in your controller to create each image such as <tt>params[:model_name][:file_attr_name].split(",").each { |file| @image = @user.project_images.create(file_url: file) }</tt>


### Displaying an image:

    <%= filepicker_image_tag @user.avatar_url, w: 160, h: 160, fit: 'clip' %>

See [the filepicker.io documentation](https://developers.filepicker.io/docs/web/#fpurl-images) for the full options list.


### Allowing the user to download a file (or upload it to any of the supported services)

    <%= filepicker_save_button "Save", @user.avatar_url, "image/jpg" %>

Full options list:

* container - Where to show the file picker dialog can be "modal", "window" or the
of an iframe on the page.
* services - What services your users can upload to. Ex: "BOX, COMPUTER, FACEBOOK".
* save_as_name - A recommended file name. The user can override this.
